    <div>Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love being outside with my friends. 
        After going on one of these tours,
         I can safely say that beer pong is my favorite game all time,
          also the cultural programs were really interesting! <br>

          <div>Wow, this really blew my mind. We had so much fun at the beach, 
            and also some hidden secrets revealed. Come on, 
            I'm living in this city for 5 years. Amazing! <br>

            <div>If you want to understand your friends better, head to the mountains. I mean, seriously.
                 It's like sitting next to a campfire and just talk in the sunset, 
                 woah. You know? It's like that. <br>
